# Linux Init Systems and Systemd Notes

## 1. What is an Init System?

* The first program that runs after the Linux kernel boots.
* Responsible for starting all other programs and services.
* Manages these programs and services after boot.
* The original init program is always Process ID (PID) 1.

## 2. The Old Way: SysV Init

* Older, simpler init system.
* **Problems:**
    * **Slow boot:** Starts programs one by one (sequentially).
    * **Complex:** Uses complicated shell scripts for configuration.
    * **Inconsistent:** Different Linux versions used different ways of managing services (e.g., Red Hat's `service` and `chkconfig`, Debian's various commands, Slackware's permission changes).

## 3. The Modern Way: systemd

* Designed to fix the problems with SysV.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Fast boot:** Starts programs at the same time (in parallel).
    * **Reliable:** Better performance and stability.
    * **Easy Management:**  Simpler configuration.  Killing a service cleanly stops all related processes.
    * **Secure:** Includes built-in security features:
        * Limits access to files and network.
        * Isolates programs (like containers).
        * Controls resource usage.
        * Manages kernel capabilities.

## 4. systemd Basics

* **Unit Files:** Configuration files that tell systemd how to manage things.  Like blueprints.
    * **Where they live:**
        * `/lib/systemd/system/`: Default, don't change these.
        * `/etc/systemd/system/`: Your custom changes go here.
    * **Types:**
        * `service`: Starts/stops programs.
        * `socket`: Network connections.
        * `target`: Groups other units.
        * `timer`: Scheduled tasks (like cron).
        * `path`: Starts services when files change.
        * `swap`: Manages swap memory.

* **Active vs. Inactive:**
    * `Active`: Running now.
    * `Inactive`: Not running, but still configured.  `systemctl list-units` shows both.

* **Important Commands:**
    * `systemctl list-units`: Shows all running and stopped services, etc.
    * `systemctl list-unit-files`: Shows all the configuration files systemd knows about.
    * `apropos <keyword>`: Finds commands related to a topic (searches man pages).

* **SUB Column:**  Gives more detail about a service's status (e.g., running, exited, failed).

## 5. Key Improvements over SysV

* Parallel startup for faster booting.
* Cleaner process management.
* Built-in security features.
* More consistent and easier to use.
